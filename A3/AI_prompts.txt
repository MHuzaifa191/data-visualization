how do i create a radial bar chart with d3.js? i want it to be dynamic, like if the user selects a different dimension it should update smoothly. data comes from a json file they upload

says expression expected or comma missing. not sure what’s wrong

how do i get all column names from a json file in js after uploading it? need to show in a dropdown so user can pick what they want to visualize

my force graph nodes can be dragged but now i want to also allow zoom and pan on the whole svg. but they seem to conflict with each other. any way to do both properly?

how to update a d3 chart (like radial one) when user picks a new value from the dropdown? i want smooth transition not hard reload

i see some examples use .enter().append() and some use .join(). which one is better for updating charts, especially when data changes?

my tooltips from different charts are overlapping each other or sometimes flickering. any idea how to fix or maybe use one common tooltip?
