# Assignment 2: Customer Review Analysis using Tableau

**Overview**:  
In this assignment, I performed an in-depth analysis of customer reviews for various products (Books and DVDs) using Tableau. A subset of the full dataset was used due to hardware limitations, with the original 70GB dataset being too large for processing on my laptop. The dataset was cleaned and calculated fields were added for **Year, Month, Quarter, Weekday**, and **Product Category** (Main, Sub, Sub-Sub, Final). The aim was to uncover actionable business insights related to customer engagement and product feedback.
